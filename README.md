# ChromaFashio[net]te :dress: :brain:
**Designing Efficient Image-to-Image Translation Artificial Neural Network Model For Segmenting Fashion Images**

ChromaFashionette is a name for the artificial neural network built during my University of Leeds AI MSc thesis.
It combines the word "chroma," which refers to color, with " **fashio[net]** te," which is fitting for a network that segments fashion images, and the ending "-ette" that denotes smallness or subtlety (efficient and small).
